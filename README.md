# GameOfLife
Game of life is a so called cellular automaton. You can read up all about it at wikipedia.

The attempt was to develop an algorithm that takes "one step" in the game of life. The behaviour examples may simply be the rules of the game:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
